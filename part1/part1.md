1. Variable i is only scoped to the for loop, so undefined will be printed.
2. Variable discountedPrice is only scoped to the for loop, so undefined will be printed.
3. Variable finalPrice will be printed because it is declared in the same method in which it is printed.
4. The function will return [50, 100, 150]. For each element in the prices array, it is multiplied by one minus the discount (in this case, still 0.5). That price is then rounded to the nearest hundredth and added to the returned array.

5. Variable i is only scoped to the for loop, so undefined will be printed.
6. Variable discountedPrice is only scoped to the for loop, so undefined will be printed.
7. Variable finalPrice will be printed because it is declared in the same method in which it is printed.
8. The function will return [50, 100, 150]. It behaves the same way as the previously described function.

9. Variable i is only scoped to the for loop, so undefined will be printed.
10. Variable discountedPrice is only scoped to the for loop, so undefined will be printed.
11. Variable finalPrice is a constant, so its originally assigned value will be printed.

16. == compares values, === compares values and types

17. 'How are you?' gets printed, since true casts to 1, which isn't equal to 2, but 2 gets cast to true, which means the else if block runs.

19. The result would be [6, 8, 10]. For each element in array, the callback function is called with the element and a function that increases the value by 2. The result of this is plugged into the provided callback function, which returns the number multiplied by 2. Finally, this result is stored in the array to be returned.
